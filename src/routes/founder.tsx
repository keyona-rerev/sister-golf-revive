            SisterGolf is the brainchild of Shella Sylla, ex-banking executive with over 18
            years in the financial services industry. Shella experienced firsthand how golf
            can positively impact your career or business after taking up the sport early
            on in her banking career. As a result of signing up for and taking lessons, in
            a few short months she went from struggling to meet her monthly goal of
            $500,000 to being a repeat member of the “Million Dollar” club — a designation
            given to associates who exceeded $1 million in production in any given month.
          </p>
          <p>
            While reaping the rewards of this newfound “secret” to success, Shella noticed
            that very few women, if any at all, were taking advantage of the business
            development and relationship building opportunities that golf has to offer.
            This prompted her to create SisterGolf as a tool for helping women learn and
            leverage the game of golf for business and career success.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shortly after launching a series of workshops, clinics and events designed to
            help women get in the game, Shella began getting numerous requests from male
            executives and professionals to provide a similar program for them. As a
            result, what began as a quest to empower women in the workplace expanded to
            include a curriculum that benefits both male and female professionals
            interested in using golf as a tool for relationship building and professional
            engagement.
